## The Data
The Dataset used was Fake.Br Corpus. I would like to thank Roney Santos and everyone involved in the development of this dataset, which was incredibly well done and saved me a lot of time and work. This project would not have been possible with such outcomes without a nicely collected and cleaned-up data, like the one from Fake.Br Corpus.
